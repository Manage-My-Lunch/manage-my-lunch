## Contributing

This project has several user stories and features that are being implemented over several sprints.
These user stories are listed as GitHub issues in this repository as well as a GitHub Project.

### Branches

For earch user story, the team member working on that user story needs to create a branch in the repository with their name and a brief title of the user story/feature being worked on (i.e. `name-home-page`). Throughout the development of the user story, the developer(s) must use the dedicated branch.

Contributions should never be directly committed to `main` with the exception of adjustments markdown documentation or urgent minor fixes.

### Pull Requests

Once you have finished development and are ready for your contribution to be merged into the `main` branch, you need to create a pull request with a description of what you are contributing.
Since this project mainly uses user stories, you should provide the user story, the acceptance tests that were or were not completed, and any additional features or changes that were made that may be outside that scope of the user story.

Once a pull request is made, the request must be reviewed by at least one other developer, however, it is encouraged to get the request reviewed by as many developers as possible. Reviewing the contributions of a pull request requires a developer to inspect the code for quality, any potential security issues, and how the contributions fit into the project's structure. Reviews are meant to be helpful and constructive.

Once a developer has reviewed the pull request, they can either approve the pull request, approve with changes/suggestions, or reject it entirely.

ðŸŸ¢ Approved means the pull request is ready to be merged into `main`. Feedback is still welcome.

ðŸŸ¡ Approved with changes/suggestions means that any feedback/suggestions need to be implemented before merging. Once changes are made then the developer may merge the changes at any time without further review.

ðŸ”´ Rejected means that the code needs to be refactored or significantly modified before it can be merged. Requires a new review after new changes. All security issues should be rejected. Rejected pull requests should also be discussed with other team members to reduce conflict or misunderstandings.

### Merging

After a branch has been merged, the branch should be deleted.

In some situations a branch may be merged but the development for the story is not complete. In this situation the branch should remain open.

## Get started

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).
